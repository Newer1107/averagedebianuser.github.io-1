      <p>This webpage is currently a placeholder, I'll make an actual one later.</p>

      <a href="https://mega.nz/file/0HVxQYJI#NptTljEZQDUZI6yf-2IKDSPGYXNW_xqPLBx6E1GIHJQ">SkibidiOS 0.01 download link (mega.nz, 1.1GB download, 3GB decompressed)</a>
      <br>
      <p>The file is a raw QEMU .img, this can probably be flashed onto a USB stick, it's 3 gigabytes even though the install only takes up about 2 gigabytes, this is so that you can actually install things when trying out in QEMU.</p>
      <p>Note that this is STILL UNFINISHED, I would release this later but decided to push out an early release.</p>
      <p>"This sucks" Yes it does, it's a joke.</P>
